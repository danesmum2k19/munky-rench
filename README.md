# MUNKY RENCH
is the apk swiss army knife for linux. It will also be as self-contained and noob friendly as possible.

At this time, all listed features function in testing, but I have not incorporated all the features that I have planned for this project. Features include unzip, zip, install frameworks, decompile and recompile, signapk, zipalign, adb install, adb push/pull, fastboot flash recovery, heimdall flash recovery, and a flashable zip generator. 

Future features may include kitchen functionality, other suggested features, some optimization things, and some partition dumping if I can mount the file system rw.

The goal is to provide a single tool that does the job of as many as possible, while maintaining a user-friendly explanitory atmosphere that informs the inexperienced without getting in the way of the power users.
